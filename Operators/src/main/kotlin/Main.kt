//    Shorthand operators are same as seen in C/C++
//    Operator precedence is also as seen in C/C++
//    Concept of post-increment/decrement and pre-increment/decrement is also observed
//    Concept of comments are also discussed which is same as seen in C/C++
//    if condition and conditional operators are discussed.
//    Logical operators are also discussed.
